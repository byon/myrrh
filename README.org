myrrh is a logging library I implemented at around 2006-2007 so that I would
have something to show when looking for work. I published it recently in
GitHub for the same purpose.

Admittedly the library would benefit from a face-lift. It is written in
C++98 and would probably look prettier with additions from C++11. Also I've
learned a few things so I would do quite many things differently. Especially
with unit tests. Let's see if I ever come around to do it.
